StatusAlert is an iOS framework that displays status alerts similar to Apple's system self-hiding alerts. It is well suited for notifying user without interrupting user flow in iOS-like way.

It looks very similar to the alerts displayed in Podcasts, Apple Music and News apps.

## Usage

```swift
// Importing framework
import StatusAlert

// Creating StatusAlert instance
let statusAlert = StatusAlert.instantiate(withImage: UIImage(named: "Some image name"),
					  title: "StatusAlert title",
					  message: "Message to show beyond title",
					  canBePickedOrDismissed: isUserInteractionAllowed)

// Presenting created instance
statusAlert.show(in: viewShowAlertIn,
		 withVerticalPosition: .center(offset: 0))
```
> All the alert components (`image`, `title`, `message`) are optional, but at least one should be present. Otherwise `show()` method will be ignored.
>
> **IMPORTANT**
>  > The alert must be presented only from the main thread, otherwise application will crash with an appropriate error.

## Customization

### Different configurations

Present alert with any set of image, title and message

### Vertical position

Display alert anywhere you want, either on the top, in the center or at the bottom of the view, and with any offset.

### Appearance

You can customize a single alert's appearance via the `StatusAlert`'s properties

```swift
public var titleFont: UIFont
public var messageFont: UIFont
public var contentColor: UIColor
```
or for all alerts at once with `StatusAlert.Appearance`'s properties

```swift
public static var titleFont: UIFont
public static var messageFont: UIFont
public static var contentColor: UIColor
```

### Dismissal

Alert will hide itself after 2 seconds timeout.

You can also pass `canBePickedOrDismissed: true` into `StatusAlert`'s `instantiate` method. After that you will also be able to dismiss the alert manually by tap it and long tap the alert to delay dismissal.
